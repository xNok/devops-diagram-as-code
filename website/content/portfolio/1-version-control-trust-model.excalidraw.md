In this article, I dive into the essential world of version control security, focusing on Git, to highlight the critical aspects of 

* Risk assessment
* Repository access permissions
* Developer identification. 

These pillars are key to safeguarding your code from unauthorized access and modifications, ensuring a secure software supply chain. The diagram you see here covers the risk assessment around the version control repository.

The attacker has essentially two angles:

* A direct attack exploiting vulnerabilities of the 
* An Impersonation attack by stilling the credentials from one of the developers

The second option is far more likely; thus, it is important to focus on the people aspect of security and ensure developers are familiar with security best practices.
