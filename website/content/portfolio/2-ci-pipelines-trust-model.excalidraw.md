In this technical blog article, you will learn how to enhance the security of your Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines. 

By following best practices and utilizing tools such as Static Code Analysis (SAST) and a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), you will understand how to validate your code and ensure the security of the artefacts you create.

Additionally, you will discover the importance of adopting the principle of least privilege in your pipelines to mitigate potential security breaches. We often give our CI system way too many permissions, making it the most at-risk system in the entire software delivery lifecycle.

By the end of the article, you will have the knowledge to strengthen the security of your CI pipelines and protect your development and deployment process.
