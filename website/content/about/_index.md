Greetings! I'm a Developer Experience (DevExp) Engineer at ESL FACEIT Group, where my role revolves around enhancing and streamlining our GCP Cloud infrastructure, software delivery processes, and the overall software platform.

In addition to my work, I'm a dedicated freelance technical content writer. My writing spans a wide range of topics, including DevOps, cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, programming, and SCRUM. If you're interested in exploring my thoughts and insights, you can find all my published articles in the "Posts" section. I've been actively contributing to the tech community for several years, and I'm truly passionate about sharing my knowledge with fellow enthusiasts.

My current focus in both work and writing are Backstage and Kubernetes, exploring new possibilities and pushing the boundaries of what's both tools can offer.

Feel free to reach out, connect, or simply explore my articles!
